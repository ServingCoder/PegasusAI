# **Mission No-Fail Weather Tracker – iOS Weather App**  

## **Version Control**  
This repository contains the source code for Mission No-Fail Weather Tracker, an iOS weather app built for Pegasus AI using Swift and Xcode. I selected Edmonton, Jasper and Banff as take-off locations. When clicking on Edmonton, the user can get real-time weather data for confrimation that the team is mission-ready.

## **About Me**  
I am Sandra Taskovic, a University of Alberta undergraduate computing scientist applying for the IOS Software Developer Co-op postion with Pegasus AI. This project was completed over a weekend to explore real-time weather updates, notifications, and branding integration to demonstate my commitment to being a proactive and contributing team-member to the Pegasus team.

## **About the Project**  
PegAI provides real-time weather updates and notifications based on the user’s location. The app integrates:  
- **Open-Meteo API** for fetching weather data  
- **Push Notifications** for weather alerts to the user  
- **Real-time Updates** for a mission-ready experience
- **Pegasus AI Branding** my own front-end design :)  

### **Figma Prototype**

## **Source Code**  
The app is built using Swift on Xcode. The source code can be found in this repository.  


## **Next Steps**  
- **MongoDB Integration**: Store user weather data for historical tracking. I have experience using MongoDB and SQL from a university course, CMPUT 291, on databases. 
- **BLE Peripheral Integration**: Explore Bluetooth connectivity for extended functionality potentially with hardware for addiontal feratures to know if the team is misison-ready.   
- **Offline Storage**: Enable access to past weather data without an internet connection  

This project was a great learning experience. Thank you for considering my application.
